# Padded bar with transparency

I combined the two patches

https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/barpadding/

and

https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/alpha/

I've also tweaked the tiling function so that windows spawn with some space between the bar and the window, currently this only works well for the first two windows,
the third and fourth window height & position are still off, for some reason when you've spawned four windows and then spawn the fifth - everything more or less comes together.
